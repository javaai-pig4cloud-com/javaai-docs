title: "Chat Model API"
---

The Chat Model API offers developers the ability to integrate AI-powered chat completion capabilities into their applications. It leverages pre-trained language models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to generate human-like responses to user inputs in natural language.

The API typically works by sending a prompt or partial conversation to the AI model, which then generates a completion or continuation of the conversation based on its training data and understanding of natural language patterns. The completed response is then returned to the application, which can present it to the user or use it for further processing.

The `Spring AI Chat Model API` is designed to be a simple and portable interface for interacting with various [AI Models](/spring4ai/overview/concepts#models), allowing developers to switch between different models with minimal code changes.
This design aligns with Spring's philosophy of modularity and interchangeability.

Also with the help of companion classes like `Prompt` for input encapsulation and `ChatResponse` for output handling, the Chat Model API unifies the communication with AI Models.
It manages the complexity of request preparation and response parsing, offering a direct and simplified API interaction.

You can find more about available implementations in the [Available Implementations](#available-implementations) section as well as detailed comparison in the [Chat Models Comparison](/spring4ai/api/chat/comparison) section.

## API Overview

This section provides a guide to the Spring AI Chat Model API interface and associated classes.

### ChatModel

Here is the [ChatModel](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-client-chat/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat//model/ChatModel.java) interface definition:

```java
public interface ChatModel extends Model<Prompt, ChatResponse> {

	default String call(String message) {...}

    @Override
	ChatResponse call(Prompt prompt);
}
```

The `call()` method with a `String` parameter simplifies initial use, avoiding the complexities of the more sophisticated `Prompt` and `ChatResponse` classes.
In real-world applications, it is more common to use the `call()` method that takes a `Prompt` instance and returns a `ChatResponse`.

### StreamingChatModel

Here is the [StreamingChatModel](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-model/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/model/StreamingChatModel.java) interface definition:

```java
public interface StreamingChatModel extends StreamingModel<Prompt, ChatResponse> {

    default Flux<String> stream(String message) {...}

    @Override
	Flux<ChatResponse> stream(Prompt prompt);
}
```

The `stream()` method takes a `String` or `Prompt` parameter similar to `ChatModel` but it streams the responses using the reactive Flux API.

### Prompt

The [Prompt](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-client-chat/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/prompt/Prompt.java) is a `ModelRequest` that encapsulates a list of [Message](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-model/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/messages/Message.java) objects and optional model request options.
The following listing shows a truncated version of the `Prompt` class, excluding constructors and other utility methods:

```java
public class Prompt implements ModelRequest<List<Message>> {

    private final List<Message> messages;

    private ChatOptions modelOptions;

	@Override
	public ChatOptions getOptions() {...}

	@Override
	public List<Message> getInstructions() {...}

    // constructors and utility methods omitted
}
```

#### Message

The `Message` interface encapsulates a `Prompt` textual content, a collection of metadata attributes, and a categorization known as `MessageType`.

The interface is defined as follows:

```java
public interface Content {

	String getText();

	Map<String, Object> getMetadata();
}

public interface Message extends Content {

	MessageType getMessageType();
}
```

The multimodal message types implement also the `MediaContent` interface providing a list of `Media` content objects.

```java
public interface MediaContent extends Content {

	Collection<Media> getMedia();

}
```

The `Message` interface has various implementations that correspond to the categories of messages that an AI model can process:

<Frame caption="Spring AI Message API">
  <img src="/images/spring-ai-message-api.jpg" width="800" />
</Frame>

The chat completion endpoint, distinguish between message categories based on conversational roles, effectively mapped by the `MessageType`.

For instance, OpenAI recognizes message categories for distinct conversational roles such as `system`, `user`, `function`, or `assistant`.

While the term `MessageType` might imply a specific message format, in this context it effectively designates the role a message plays in the dialogue.

For AI models that do not use specific roles, the `UserMessage` implementation acts as a standard category, typically representing user-generated inquiries or instructions.
To understand the practical application and the relationship between `Prompt` and `Message`, especially in the context of these roles or message categories, see the detailed explanations in the [Prompts](/spring4ai/api/prompt) section.

#### Chat Options

Represents the options that can be passed to the AI model. The `ChatOptions` class is a subclass of `ModelOptions` and is used to define few portable options that can be passed to the AI model.
The `ChatOptions` class is defined as follows:

```java
public interface ChatOptions extends ModelOptions {

	String getModel();
	Float getFrequencyPenalty();
	Integer getMaxTokens();
	Float getPresencePenalty();
	List<String> getStopSequences();
	Float getTemperature();
	Integer getTopK();
	Float getTopP();
	ChatOptions copy();

}
```

Additionally, every model specific ChatModel/StreamingChatModel implementation can have its own options that can be passed to the AI model. For example, the OpenAI Chat Completion model has its own options like `logitBias`, `seed`, and `user`.

This is a powerful feature that allows developers to use model-specific options when starting the application and then override them at runtime using the `Prompt` request.

Spring AI provides a sophisticated system for configuring and using Chat Models. 
It allows for default configurations to be set at start-up, while also providing the flexibility to override these settings on a per-request basis. 
This approach enables developers to easily work with different AI models and adjust parameters as needed, all within a consistent interface provided by the Spring AI framework.

Following flow diagram illustrates how Spring AI handles the configuration and execution of Chat Models, combining start-up and runtime options:

<Frame caption="Chat Options Flow">
  <img src="/images/chat-options-flow.jpg" width="800px" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start-up Configuration">
    The ChatModel/StreamingChatModel is initialized with "Start-Up" Chat Options. These options are set during the ChatModel initialization and are meant to provide default configurations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Runtime Configuration">
    For each request, the Prompt can contain a Runtime Chat Options: These can override the start-up options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Option Merging Process">
    The "Merge Options" step combines the start-up and runtime options. If runtime options are provided, they take precedence over the start-up options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Input Processing">
    The "Convert Input" step transforms the input instructions into native, model-specific formats.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Output Processing">
    The "Convert Output" step transforms the model's response into a standardized `ChatResponse` format.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The separation of start-up and runtime options allows for both global configurations and request-specific adjustments.

### ChatResponse

The structure of the `ChatResponse` class is as follows:

```java
public class ChatResponse implements ModelResponse<Generation> {

    private final ChatResponseMetadata chatResponseMetadata;
	private final List<Generation> generations;

	@Override
	public ChatResponseMetadata getMetadata() {...}

    @Override
	public List<Generation> getResults() {...}

    // other methods omitted
}
```

The [ChatResponse](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-model/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/model/ChatResponse.java) class holds the AI Model's output, with each `Generation` instance containing one of potentially multiple outputs resulting from a single prompt.

The `ChatResponse` class also carries a `ChatResponseMetadata` metadata about the AI Model's response.

### Generation

Finally, the [Generation](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-model/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/chat/model/Generation.java) class extends from the `ModelResult` to represent the model output (assistant message) and related metadata:

```java
public class Generation implements ModelResult<AssistantMessage> {

	private final AssistantMessage assistantMessage;
	private ChatGenerationMetadata chatGenerationMetadata;

	@Override
	public AssistantMessage getOutput() {...}

	@Override
	public ChatGenerationMetadata getMetadata() {...}

    // other methods omitted
}
```
