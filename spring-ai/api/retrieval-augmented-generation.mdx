## Key Components

- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
- **Augmentation**: Enhancing the context with retrieved information
- **Generation**: Creating responses based on the augmented context

## Benefits

- Improved accuracy and relevance of responses
- Better handling of domain-specific knowledge
- Reduced hallucinations in generated content
- Enhanced context awareness
