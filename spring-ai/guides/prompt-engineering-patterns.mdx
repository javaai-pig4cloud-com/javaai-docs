# Prompt Engineering Patterns

This guide covers common patterns and best practices for prompt engineering in Spring AI applications.

## Overview

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts to get the best results from AI models.

## Common Patterns

### Chain of Thought

```java
String prompt = """
    Let's solve this step by step:
    1. First, analyze the problem
    2. Then, break it down into parts
    3. Finally, provide a solution
    
    Problem: {problem}
    """;
```

### Few-Shot Learning

```java
String prompt = """
    Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Input: "What is the capital of France?"
    Output: "Paris"
    
    Example 2:
    Input: "What is the capital of Japan?"
    Output: "Tokyo"
    
    Now, answer this:
    Input: "{question}"
    """;
```

### Role-Based Prompts

```java
String prompt = """
    You are an expert software architect. 
    Your task is to review the following code and provide suggestions:
    
    {code}
    """;
```

## Best Practices

1. Be specific and clear
2. Provide context
3. Use examples when possible
4. Break down complex tasks
5. Include constraints and requirements

## Advanced Techniques

### Temperature Control

```java
ChatOptions options = ChatOptions.builder()
    .withTemperature(0.7)
    .build();
```

### System Messages

```java
String systemMessage = """
    You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Java development.
    Always provide code examples in Java.
    """;
```

## Testing and Evaluation

- Use test cases to validate prompts
- Measure response quality
- Iterate and improve based on results
