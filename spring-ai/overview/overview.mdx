The `Spring AI` project aims to streamline the development of applications that incorporate artificial intelligence functionality without unnecessary complexity.

The project draws inspiration from notable Python projects, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, but Spring AI is not a direct port of those projects.
The project was founded with the belief that the next wave of Generative AI applications will not be only for Python developers but will be ubiquitous across many programming languages.

<Note>Spring AI addresses the fundamental challenge of AI integration: **Connecting your enterprise Data and APIs with AI Models**.</Note>

Spring AI provides abstractions that serve as the foundation for developing AI applications.
These abstractions have multiple implementations, enabling easy component swapping with minimal code changes.

## Features

Spring AI provides the following features:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Model Support" icon="robot">
    Portable API support across AI providers for Chat, text-to-image, and Embedding models. Both synchronous and streaming API options are supported. Access to model-specific features is also available.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="AI Model Providers" icon="building">
    Support for all major AI Model providers such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Ollama. Supported model types include:
    
    - [Chat Completion](/spring4ai/api/chatmodel)
    - [Embedding](/spring4ai/api/embeddings)
    - [Text to Image](/spring4ai/api/imageclient)
    - [Audio Transcription](/spring4ai/api/audio/transcriptions)
    - [Text to Speech](/spring4ai/api/audio/speech)
    - [Moderation](/spring4ai/api/moderation)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Structured Outputs" icon="code">
    [Structured Outputs](/spring4ai/api/structured-output-converter) - Mapping of AI Model output to POJOs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Vector Database Support" icon="database">
    Support for all major Vector Database providers such as Apache Cassandra, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Vector Search, Chroma, Elasticsearch, GemFire, MariaDB, Milvus, MongoDB Atlas, Neo4j, OpenSearch, Oracle, PostgreSQL/PGVector, PineCone, Qdrant, Redis, SAP Hana, Typesense and Weaviate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tools & Function Calling" icon="wrench">
    [Tools/Function Calling](/spring4ai/api/tools) - Permits the model to request the execution of client-side tools and functions, thereby accessing necessary real-time information as required and taking action.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Observability" icon="eye">
    [Observability](/spring4ai/observability) - Provides insights into AI-related operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="ETL Framework" icon="gears">
    Document ingestion [ETL framework](/spring4ai/api/etl-pipeline) for Data Engineering.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Model Evaluation" icon="chart-line">
    [AI Model Evaluation](/spring4ai/api/testing) - Utilities to help evaluate generated content and protect against hallucinated response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Spring Boot Integration" icon="spring">
    Spring Boot Auto Configuration and Starters for AI Models and Vector Stores.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="ChatClient API" icon="comments">
    [ChatClient API](/spring4ai/api/chatclient) - Fluent API for communicating with AI Chat Models, idiomatically similar to the WebClient and RestClient APIs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Advisors API" icon="user-gear">
    [Advisors API](/spring4ai/api/advisors) - Encapsulates recurring Generative AI patterns, transforms data sent to and from Language Models (LLMs), and provides portability across various models and use cases.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Memory & RAG" icon="brain">
    Support for [Chat Conversation Memory](/spring4ai/api/chatclient#chat-memory) and [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/spring4ai/api/chatclient#retrieval-augmented-generation).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This feature set lets you implement common use cases, such as "Q&A over your documentation" or "Chat with your documentation."
